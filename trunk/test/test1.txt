The program provides comprehensive child development services for low income children and families in Miami-Dade County. The program is open to children ages new born through age 5, and provides care and instruction for children in a classroom setting.

Head Start provides a variety of services that are aimed at enhancing the lives of children, building strong family units, and providing opportunities for empowering and obtaining self sufficiency by collaborating with other Community Action Agency programs and projects. Head Start provides services to its participants in the following areas.

Education involves providing a learning environment, which helps children, develop socially, intellectually, physically and emotionally in a manner appropriate to their age and state of development. An individualized approach is taken towards assessing the needs of a child. The parent is encouraged to be an integral part of the development of the child and learning process. 

A comprehensive health program is provided to promote preventive health services and early intervention. The family of the child is provided with the necessary skills and insight to link the family to an on-going health care system to insure continued comprehensive healthcare. Head Start/Early Head Start health services include: medical, dental, and developmental screening, exams and follow-up, nutritional services, mental health services, and health education.

Disabled children and families receive the full range of services received by all Head Start/Early Head Start participants. Children suspected of having a disabling condition and/or children with a disability are provided services to include outreach recruitment/enrollment, screening for possible intervention, development and implementation of the Individual Education Plan (IEP) and transition into Head Start and later into their local school district.

Social Services involves recruitment and enrollment of children, serving as an advocate for Head Start families, and assisting families in becoming aware of community resources to improve the condition and quality of family life. Services are also available to assist families in their own efforts to become self-sufficient. 

Parents are an essential part of the Head Start/Early Head Start program since they are active participants in classroom and parent group activities, in the growth of their child, and in the program planning and decision-making process. They serve on parent committees and may represent their center on the Head Start Policy Council.

This has turned out to be a surprisingly difficult task because PDF is focused entirely on the visual aspect of a bunch of pages with no notion of text, paragraphs etc. Some commercial software based on OCR techniques apparently does a good job, but I've never seen it work. Neither Adobe, nor Linux's excellent pdftotext or pdftohtml do a descent job on handling columnized text. Here is a student project that we should try to get up and running and prehaps expand upon as it goes right into the heart of the problem:

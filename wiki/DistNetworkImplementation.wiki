#summary The implementation of distributed dataflow communication

The implementation relies on the distributed HGDB framework for managing network communication, list of peers and asynchronous activities.

To each dataflow network instance there is a corresponding org.hypergraphdb.peer.workflow.Activity instance that handles all channel communication for the network. The ID of the activity is the persistent handle UUID of the network atom.

#summary Distributing Processor Load

Many implementations of dataflow processors process some input to produce some output in a rather stateless fashion. Such processors can be load balanced by creating copies of them and splitting the work between each copy. Suppose a processor P takes input from a single channel I and produces output to a single channel O:

{{{
I -> P -> O
}}}

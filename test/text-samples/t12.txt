Certificates of Competency

The Product Control Division of the Building Code Compliance Office is the authority having jurisdiction in the Miami-Dade County to issue a Certificate of Competency to Fabricators and manufacturers of those building products that are of expendable nature and can not received an individual product approval notice.  Examples of these products are: ready-mixed concrete, custom-designed and built products, as in the case of structural steel fabrication or prefabricated wood trusses; or as required by the uniform Building Code.

Not renewing the certification will constitute a violation of Miami-Dade County Administrative Order 10-3 and will be grounds for our office to notify all Building Officials in Miami-Dade County and, in cases regarding prefabricated metal plate-connected wood trusses, also Building Officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.  Consequently, manufacturers of these building products would not be able to distribute and/or use them in Miami-Dade County and, if applicable, Broward and Palm Beach Counties respectively, without a current and valid certificate of competency.

Fabricators of metal plate connected wood trusses are also subject to unannounced inspections by an authorized lumber inspection bureau or an authorized agency such as Southern Pine Inspection Bureau, Inc., Timber Products Inspections, Inc. or Stafford Inspection and Consulting Services, LLC. In addition to the lumber inspections, these fabricators are also subjected to fabrication inspections by any of the above mentioned agencies or an authorized Florida registered professional engineer, or an authorized independent testing laboratory under the supervision of a professional engineer registered in the State of Florida.  Monthly fabrication and lumber inspections reports are submitted to the Quality Assurance Unit which administers the Certificate of Competency Program for the Product Control Division. These reports are reviewed, logged and monitored to ensure compliance to FBC 2319.17.2.3.4 and FBC 2319.17.2.3.5.
